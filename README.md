On 18 June 2019, 12 people were injured when the cables holding the right platform of the free fall tower snapped while the ride was descending, causing the riders to plunge 10 feet (3.0 m) to the ground. 
First aid was administered and no serious injuries were sustained.[2]<br> Following the incident, the park has been ordered to close indefinitely due to ride safety concerns.[3]
