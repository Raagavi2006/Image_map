        <h1>Incidents</h1>
        <p>
            The park was closed for few weeks in 2008 due to a collision that resulted in the death of an 11-year-old girl while she was riding in a water boat in the lake.[1] <br>
            Seven employees were arrested in connection with the death.

On 18 June 2019, 12 people were injured when the cables holding the right platform of the free fall tower snapped while the ride was descending, causing the riders to plunge 10 feet (3.0 m) to the ground. 
First aid was administered and no serious injuries were sustained.[2]<br> Following the incident, the park has been ordered to close indefinitely due to ride safety concerns.[3]
